# Fastsapp agent guide

Fastsapp is a small native WhatsApp client: Rust, egui, and the
[whatsapp-rust](https://github.com/oxidezap/whatsapp-rust) library for the
protocol. These notes are for coding agents and new contributors.

## Product boundaries

- Keep it a small native client. No browser engine, no telemetry, no
  hosted backend, no second account system.
- The protocol comes from whatsapp-rust. Do not reimplement pieces of it
  here, and do not advertise a capability merely because a protobuf field
  for it exists.
- Do not broaden a task into adjacent features or a general refactor.
  Preserve existing user behaviour unless the task changes it.

## Architecture

- `src/ui/` draws views and pushes `model::Action`s; `src/app.rs` applies
  them after the frame. Never mutate application state from inside a view
  beyond the view's own fields (composer text, search text, flags).
- `src/backend.rs` is the interface's handle to a tokio runtime on its own
  thread; `src/backend/worker.rs` runs there. It owns the whatsapp-rust
  `Bot`, the message archive, downloads, and profile pictures. The two
  sides talk only through `Command` (interface to runtime) and `Event`
  (runtime to interface); every event wakes the window through `Waker`.
- `src/archive.rs` is the SQLite store of chats, messages, contacts, and
  privacy-id mappings. WhatsApp replays history once, at link time, so the
  archive is the only copy. It keeps each message's raw protobuf because
  the keys to fetch an attachment live in it.
- `src/model.rs` holds the app's own types. Views never touch a protobuf;
  the worker translates in `classify()` and `parse_conversation()`.
- Chat ids are canonical strings: a chat behind a privacy id (`@lid`) is
  filed under its phone number once the mapping is known. Use
  `Worker::canonical` for anything that arrives as a `Jid`.
- `src/theme.rs` owns colours, fonts, and icons; `src/ui/widgets.rs` the
  shared controls. New icons go in `assets/icons/` as 24px Lucide-style SVGs
  and in the `icons!` table.
- `src/markup.rs` turns WhatsApp's text markup, links, and mentions into an
  egui `LayoutJob`; `src/emoji.rs` swaps every emoji for a placeholder
  glyph at layout time and paints the desktop's colour emoji bitmap over
  it afterwards (resolving sequences through the font's GSUB ligatures).
  Any text that can hold an emoji goes through `widgets::line` /
  `widgets::rich_text` or `markup::layout`, never a bare `Label`.
- `src/animation.rs` plays animated stickers and GIFs: WebP/GIF frames
  decode in-process, and so do MP4s (the `mp4` crate demuxes, `openh264`
  decodes the H.264 WhatsApp uses, samples converted from AVCC to Annex
  B); `ffmpeg` is only a fallback for other codecs. `openh264` compiles
  its C++ from source with the C++ compiler of the host; `nasm` is
  optional and only adds the SIMD paths (the AUR recipes leave it out,
  the build works without it). Frames become textures on the interface
  thread and are dropped when unseen.
- `src/voice.rs` is the codec for voice messages: OGG/Opus in and out
  (the `ogg` crate for the container, `opus` with libopus bundled and
  built by cmake for the codec, so cmake is a build dependency), plus
  the 64-bar waveform WhatsApp draws and a mono/48 kHz resampler.
  `src/audio.rs` is the sound: `Player` plays one clip at a time through
  rodio (OGG/Opus through `voice`, MP3/M4A/WAV through rodio's decoders,
  decoded on a thread, the device opened on demand and released when the
  clip ends) and `Recorder` reads the default microphone through rodio's
  `Microphone` on a thread, keeping a loudness per 50 ms for the live bars.
  Linux needs ALSA headers to build (`libasound2-dev` on Debian,
  `alsa-lib` on Arch). `Action::PlayVoice/SeekVoice` drive the player from
  the bubble; `StartRecording/CancelRecording/SendRecording` the
  microphone from the composer (the send button is a microphone when there
  is nothing to send); `Command::SendVoice` encodes and sends push-to-talk
  with the waveform, `Command::MarkPlayed` sends the played receipt once
  per incoming voice message.
  `src/ui/picker.rs` is the emoji/GIF/sticker panel. GIF search uses the
  key from Settings, else one baked in at build time from
  `FASTSAPP_GIPHY_KEY` (`option_env!`); the repository carries none. The
  phone's recently used stickers arrive in `HistorySync.recent_stickers`
  when the device links and live in the archive's `stickers` table as raw
  `StickerMetadata`, fetched when the picker opens; favourite stickers sync
  through app state (`FavoriteSticker`), which whatsapp-rust does not
  surface, so they are not shown.
- `src/paths.rs` moves a setup left by the app's earlier name
  (`fastwhatsapp`) over once, so the linked device survives the rename.
- The app outlives the window, as in fastpotify: `main` runs
  `eframe::run_native` in a loop; closing the window with "keep running"
  on sets `hide_intent`, the window is destroyed, and a headless loop keeps
  calling `App::background_frame` (the link, the archive, the tray) until
  the tray, a clicked notification, or another launch sets `wants_show`,
  when a new window is made. `src/tray.rs` is the Linux status notifier
  (ksni), `src/tray_native.rs` the Windows and macOS item (tray-icon; on
  macOS made with the first window and pumped by `tray::idle` while none
  exists). `src/single_instance.rs` holds a loopback port so a second
  launch surfaces the first. `src/notify.rs` sends desktop notifications
  for `Event::Incoming` (live messages from others, not history) when the
  reader is away from that chat. macOS has no title bar: the content runs
  to the top and `ui::titlebar_strip` leaves `theme::titlebar_inset` for
  the traffic lights and drags the window.
- The name and icon under the phone's Linked devices come from
  `DevicePropsOverride` in `start_bot` (`os` is the name shown, the
  platform type picks the icon); WhatsApp reads them at pairing only, so a
  change shows after unlinking and linking again.
- Older history comes from the phone on demand (`Command::FetchOlder` →
  `Client::fetch_message_history` → a `HistorySync` chunk with
  `sync_type == ON_DEMAND`); the archive is paged first, the phone only
  when it is exhausted.
- Platform-specific code belongs behind `cfg` blocks; a change for one
  platform must keep the other two compiling.

Three egui pitfalls this code has already hit:

- `consume_key(Modifiers::NONE, key)` also matches the key with Shift held
  (egui only insists on the modifiers you ask for), so the composer
  inspects the events itself to tell Enter from Shift+Enter.
- `with_layout(..., Align::Center)` directly inside a vertical container
  claims the whole available height; wrap it in `ui.horizontal`.
- `ui.horizontal` inside a right-aligned bubble lays out right to left;
  see `mirrored_row`. A bubble's own click target is registered before its
  contents (from last frame's rect) so links and quotes inside win clicks.
- `Popup::context_menu` opens on the *response's* right-click, which those
  inner widgets take for themselves; the bubble reads the right-click from
  the input over its own rect and opens `Popup::menu` itself, so the menu
  comes up anywhere on the message.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, and push the tag: the
release workflow builds every platform and publishes the GitHub release
with `checksums.txt`. Then update the AUR packages in the maintainer's
`~/Code/aur/` clones: `fastsapp-bin` (new `pkgver`, `pkgrel=1`, the two
Linux checksums from `checksums.txt`) and `fastsapp` (new `pkgver`,
`pkgrel=1`, the source tarball's checksum from `makepkg -g`); for each,
`makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`, `makepkg -f` to prove it builds,
commit, push. `fastsapp-git` only needs touching when the build recipe or
the dependencies change.

## Definition of done

- Add focused tests for changed behaviour. The `demo` feature carries sample
  data and a headless layout test of every screen (`src/demo.rs`); extend
  the sample when a new kind of content or state is added, and use
  `--demo-shot` to look at the result.
- Update the README when user-visible behaviour, settings, files, or network
  access changes.
- Run the full checks before finishing:

  ```sh
  cargo fmt --all --check
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
  cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
  cargo test --locked --all-targets
  cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
  RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps
  ```

  Do not weaken a lint, delete a test, or add an `allow` merely to make
  them pass without explaining why the rule does not apply.
- Report platform coverage honestly: say what was run and what was only
  compiled.
- Never log message contents, phone numbers, keys, or QR payloads at a
  level that ships. The log file is meant to be attached to bug reports.
